# Project Euler Solutions

## Description

This private repository contains all of my solutions to Project Euler. I am doing them as I have free time and energy to put into. The repository contains all of the solution files, scripts to pull the dependencies, and scripts to compile and run the solutions.

```
Languages: C++, Unix shell script
```

```
Problems solved: 8
```

## Reason for making this repo private

Due to the nature of Project Euler, I made this repo private for two reasons:
- I don't want others to cheat the solutions if they somehow come across this repo.
- Project Euler forbids making solutions public past problem 100.

## How to get access to this repo

You are welcome to contact me if you are a potential employer and supply me with a github user to give access to. I will only give access to a sinlge github user of the potential employer.
